For purposes of this Agreement and as reasonably applicable, all modifications, adjustments, enhancements, bug fixes, error corrections or other updates (including any major or minor revisions, which are the ''Updates'') made by or on behalf of JKI to the JKI Product will become part of the JKI Product.
1.2 License Restrictions. YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO DISTRIBUTE THE JKI PRODUCT YOU OBTAIN HEREUNDER ON A STANDALONE BASIS (I.E., FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION INDEPENDENT OF THE CUSTOMER PRODUCT). THE JKI PRODUCT SHALL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE CUSTOMER PRODUCT SUCH THAT JKI TRADE SECRET AND/OR SOURCE CODE INFORMATION IS NOT NOR IS LIKELY TO BE EXPOSED TO SUBLICENSEES NOR ANY THIRD PARTY; FOR EXAMPLE, THE CUSTOMER PRODUCT SHALL NOT BE A SOFTWARE LIBRARY OR ''THIN WRAPPER'' ON TOP OF THE JKI PRODUCT THAT EXPOSES THE FUNCTIONALITY OR SOURCE CODE OF THE JKI PRODUCT TO ANY THIRD PARTY. YOU WILL NOT MODIFY, DISTRIBUTE OR COMBINE THE JKI PRODUCT WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE SO AS TO (I) CREATE, OR PURPORT TO CREATE, OBLIGATIONS, LIMITATIONS, OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE PART OF JKI; OR (II) REQUIRE OR CONDITION THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH SOFTWARE OR PRODUCT ON, THE DISCLOSURE, LICENSING, DELIVERY OR DISTRIBUTION OF ANY SOURCE CODE FOR ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE JKI PRODUCT.
YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL IMPOSE SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS TO THOSE CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT ON ANY RESELLER, SUBLICENSEE, OR OTHER THIRD PARTY TO WHOM YOU REDISTRIBUTE, SUBLICENSE OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE THE JKI PRODUCT.
1.3 Ownership; Proprietary Rights. You acknowledge that the JKI Product, any Updates thereto and their structure and organization are owned by JKI and its suppliers. Accordingly, and except as expressly allowed under this Agreement, you agree (a) not to remove, alter or obscure in any way any proprietary rights notices (including copyright notices and messages indicating the code is JKI property) of JKI or its suppliers on or within the copies of the JKI Product furnished to you by JKI, and (b) that the Customer Product will include in its About Box or other applicable written documentation the notice that the Customer Product ''includes the JKI Toolkits for LabVIEW, © (year) JKI. All rights reserved.''
The JKI Product is licensed, not sold, to you and any and all rights not specifically granted to you by this Agreement, remain in JKI and its suppliers.

All modifications, adjustments, enhancements, bug fixes, error corrections or other updates (including any ''Updates'') to the JKI Product will become part of the JKI Product and will remain the exclusive property of JKI.
2. Use of Third Party Software
You understand that the JKI Product may (a) contain or be distributed with computer programs that are distributed as part of the JKI Product and for which the source code is written by persons or entities other than employees of JKI or contractors under the direction of JKI, and/or (b) include tools that access, interact with and/or utilize software object and/or source code obtained by JKI from third parties and that are separate from the JKI Product (in each case, the ''Third Party Software''). (For purposes of this Agreement, the JKI Product and any Third Party Software shall be referred to as the ''Software''.) Together with its distribution to you of the JKI Product, JKI may make some Third Party Software available to you via download or other distribution. In addition, following your installation of the JKI Product, the JKI Product may be able to, based on your instruction, connect to the internet and identify additional Third Party Software for download and installation on your computer on your behalf. This identification and installation process will require you to provide certain information, including information about the JKI Product as installed on your computer, all of which information will be gathered and used by JKI in accordance with its Privacy Policy then in effect.
JKI will endeavor to provide you with a list of the Third Party Software and notice of the associated Third Party Software license(s) and terms as of your receipt of the JKI Product; for this information, please refer to the JKI Product documentation available at http://jkisoft.com/manuals/. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANY SUCH THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE LICENSE(S), AND THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF SUCH THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE LICENSE(S). YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, PRIOR TO USING THE THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE, AND IN ANY CASE BEFORE COPYING, MODIFYING, OR DISTRIBUTING ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, YOU WILL CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE ALL NECESSARY RIGHTS AND PERMISSIONS TO DO SO FROM THE APPLICABLE THIRD PARTY LICENSOR (THE ''LICENSOR''), WHICH CONFIRMATION MAY INCLUDE OBTAINING A SEPARATE LICENSE FROM THE LICENSOR EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZING YOU TO DO SO.
3. You Will Not Use nor Disclose Our Confidential Information.
Confidential Information hereunder includes, but is not limited to: JKI Product specifications, JKI Product source code, trade secrets, know-how, inventions (whether or not patentable), techniques, processes, programs, ideas, algorithms, schematics, testing procedures, software design and architecture, internal documentation, design and function specifications, product requirements, analysis and performance information, benchmarks, software documents, and other non-public technical, business, product, marketing and financial information, plans and data of JKI (the ''Confidential Information''). You agree that all Confidential Information is the confidential property of JKI and, except with JKI's prior written consent or as required (and then only to the extent required) by law, you agree to use any Confidential Information you obtain only as permitted by this Agreement, and not to disclose any Confidential Information to third parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may disclose Confidential Information only to those of your employees and consultants as is necessary for the use expressly and unambiguously licensed hereunder, and only after such employees and contractors have agreed in writing to be bound by the obligations of nondisclosure at least as restrictive as those contained in this Agreement. Your nondisclosure obligations hereunder shall not apply to information you can document: (i) is generally available to the public other than through breach of this Agreement; (ii) is rightfully disclosed to you by a third party without any associated obligation of confidentiality; or (iii) is independently developed by you without use of or reference to any JKI Confidential Information. Because of the unique and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information, you understand and agree that JKI's remedies at law for your breach of your obligations under this Section may be inadequate and that JKI shall be entitled to seek equitable relief (including without limitation provisional and permanent injunctive relief and specific performance). Nothing stated herein shall limit any other remedies provided under this Agreement or available to JKI at law. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, you will return or destroy all copies of all JKI Confidential Information in your possession or control.

Such Feedback may include, but will not be limited to, any communications from you to JKI, including (i) any messages, content, materials or other communications posted to the http://jkisoft.com, http://jameskring.com or any other website(s) owned or maintained by JKI; and/or (ii) relating to your use and evaluation of the JKI Product. Feedback may include communications regarding: (1) which portions of the JKI Product have been used, (2) the nature of that use, (3) the extent or amount of use, (4) any errors or difficulties discovered and (5) the characteristic conditions and symptoms of the errors and difficulties. You acknowledge and agree that (i) JKI may use, in any manner and for any purpose, the information gained as a result of your use and evaluation of the JKI Product, including but not limited to the Feedback; (ii) any corrections, modifications, upgrades or improvements to the JKI Product based on such Feedback or other input shall be owned and retained entirely by JKI; and (iii) JKI shall have no obligation to correct, upgrade, modify, or otherwise support or maintain the JKI Product pursuant to this license.
4.2 Assignment. If you are ever held or deemed to hold any right, title or interest (including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights, moral rights or trade secret rights) in or to: (a) the JKI Product (including any changes, modifications or corrections thereto) and/or (b) the Feedback, whether by virtue of your provision of Feedback to JKI or otherwise, then you hereby irrevocably assign to JKI all such right, title and interest. Such assignment includes all rights in or to any invention, work of authorship, mask work, idea, information, feedback or know-how (whether or not patentable) that is conceived, learned or reduced to practice in the course of performance under this Agreement and any patent rights, copyrights (including moral rights; provided that any non-assignable moral rights are waived to the extent permitted by law), trade secret rights, mask work rights, sui generis database rights and all other intellectual and industrial property rights of any sort with respect thereto that in any way relate to or constitute the Feedback or the JKI Product. In the event that any such rights (including, by way of example and without limitation, ''moral rights,'' or other similar rights) cannot be assigned, you hereby agree to waive enforcement worldwide of such rights against JKI and hereby grant to JKI an exclusive, fully paid, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual license, with right to sublicense through multiple tiers of sub-licensees, to use, reproduce, create derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, transfer, assign and distribute in any medium or format, whether now known or later developed, any and all property that is subject to such rights. You agree to take any action reasonably requested by JKI to evidence, perfect, obtain, maintain, enforce or defend the foregoing, including executing any and all documents necessary to implement and confirm the letter and intent of this Agreement.

5.1 NO WARRANTY OR PROMISES. Your right of termination and refund described in Section 7 constitutes your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any dissatisfaction with the JKI Product. THE JKI PRODUCT, ANY UPDATES THERETO, AND ALL THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE IS DISTRIBUTED BY JKI ON AN ''AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY PROVIDED BY OR ON BEHALF OF JKI. PLEASE REFER TO THE APPLICABLE THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE LICENSE FOR ANY WARRANTY THAT MAY BE OFFERED OR DISCLAIMED BY THE LICENSOR OF SUCH SOFTWARE. WE MAKE NO OTHER WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS AS TO ANY SOFTWARE PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND WE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

<p>SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE
Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.
The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.
"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).
"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.
"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:
1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.
4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.
5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.
TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.
DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.</p>
